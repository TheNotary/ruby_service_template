TODO:
-Get the service main loop to install on a windows PC and then get it to print hello worlds to the log file
-Refactor all of the variables into strings.rb


LOG:
-I think I can just install/ deploy this on a windows server and have it just work... if it doesn't just work, then I need to do debugging on why it would stop working...  I need to clean out the main loop on the service script before it will work though... it relies on gutted dependencies...
